# **Toolbar Features**
## Background Image
A background image can be inserted to replace the default white background. The background image is to be selected from the gallery. But before accessing the gallery, permission from the user is required.

## **Download / Share**
The drawings/sketches can be saved in the gallery, for which access is to be granted by the user first, and/or shared via any medium. Sharing does not save the image in gallery and instead, saves the image in external cache with it being deleted once the app is closed.
